# Lab Management in Golang

My simple lab management tool written in Golang. Built with [Wails](https://wails.io/).

## Development

_This section is generated from the official template._

### Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

### Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.

## Install on Linux

First, build the app by following the above section.

Next, create a `labmango.desktop` file at `~/.local/share/applications/`. The template is available [here](templates/labmango.desktop).
